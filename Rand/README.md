Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)


============================================================================
#define A 1103515245
#define C 12345
#define M 2147483648

These are constants used in the code to implement the linear congruential generator (LCG) algorithm. These values are commonly used in LCG algorithms to produce a sequence of pseudo-random numbers. You can think of these constants as parameters that control the randomness and distribution of the generated numbers. These specific values are taken from a well-known LCG algorithm called the "Park-Miller" method.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
time_t seed = time(NULL) ;

This line gets the current time as a seed value for the LCG algorithm using the time() function. time(NULL) returns the current time in seconds since the Unix epoch, which is a commonly used seed value for random number generators.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
long int prev = (long int)seed;

This line generates a random number using the LCG algorithm. The value of prev is multiplied by the constant A, added to the constant C, and then taken modulo M to produce a new pseudo-random value. This new value is assigned to the variable rand_num.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)

This is a loop that generates 10 random numbers using the LCG algorithm.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
rand_num = rand_num % 100 + 1;

This line scales the random number generated by the LCG algorithm to a range between 1 and 100. This is done by taking the modulo of rand_num with 100 to ensure it's between 0 and 99, then adding 1 to shift it to the range of 1 to 100.
